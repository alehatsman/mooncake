# Real-World Examples

Complete, practical examples showing how to combine Mooncake features for real-world use cases.

## Examples

### Dotfiles Manager

**[dotfiles-manager/](dotfiles-manager/)** - Complete dotfiles deployment system

Demonstrates:

- Managing configuration files across machines
- Template-based dynamic configs
- OS-specific configurations
- Backup and deployment workflows
- Tag-based selective deployment

Perfect for:

- Setting up new development machines
- Keeping dotfiles in sync across systems
- Team configuration standardization

## Contributing Your Own

Have a great real-world example? Consider contributing it! Real-world examples should:

1. **Solve a complete problem** - Not just demonstrate one feature
2. **Be practical** - Something you'd actually use
3. **Combine features** - Show how features work together
4. **Include documentation** - Explain what it does and why
5. **Be testable** - Work with `--dry-run` for safety

## Ideas for Real-World Examples

- **Web Server Setup** - Deploy nginx + app + database
- **Development Environment** - Complete dev stack setup
- **System Hardening** - Security configurations
- **Backup System** - Automated backup routines
- **CI/CD Deployment** - Application deployment pipeline
- **Docker Host Setup** - Container environment provisioning
- **Monitoring Setup** - Prometheus + Grafana + exporters
- **WiFi Configuration** - Network profiles and VPN

## Learning Path

1. Complete the [numbered examples](../) first (01-10)
2. Study how features combine in real-world examples
3. Adapt these examples to your needs
4. Build your own real-world configurations

## Getting Help

- Review individual feature examples (01-10)
- Check the [main README](../../README.md)
- Use `--dry-run` to preview safely
- Use `--log-level debug` to troubleshoot
