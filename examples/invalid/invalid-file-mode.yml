# Example: Invalid file mode format (INVALID)
# File modes must be in octal format: "0XXX" where X is 0-7

- name: File with invalid mode - missing leading zero
  file:
    path: /tmp/test1.txt
    state: file
    mode: "644"  # Invalid: should be "0644"

- name: File with invalid mode - invalid octal digit
  file:
    path: /tmp/test2.txt
    state: file
    mode: "0888"  # Invalid: 8 is not a valid octal digit

- name: File with invalid mode - too short
  file:
    path: /tmp/test3.txt
    state: file
    mode: "07"  # Invalid: should be 4 characters like "0755"

- name: Valid file for comparison
  file:
    path: /tmp/test4.txt
    state: file
    mode: "0644"  # Valid: proper octal format
