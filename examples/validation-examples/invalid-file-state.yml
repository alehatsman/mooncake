# File state must be one of: "file", "directory", or "absent"

- name: File with invalid state
  file:
    path: /tmp/test.txt
    state: present  # Invalid: should be "file", "directory", or "absent"

- name: Another file with wrong state
  file:
    path: /tmp/testdir
    state: folder  # Invalid: should be "directory"

- name: Valid file for comparison
